# The Data Science Labs on Fourier Theory

Topics we will cover: START WITH SYNTHESIZING


What is the meaning of Fourier series coefficients?
1: Play a pure cosine wave. Play the scale. Play a song. Observe that playing song twice as fast is faster AND higher pitch. (Fourier series properties)

Arduino: make a little piano

2: Play a sum of sine and cosine waves with different coefficients. (What are the FS coefficients of sound you create).  Create your own sound (an entire scale). Play a song. 

Arduino: modify your piano to play more interesting sounds

3: record voice, scale time to create higher pitch; play a song.

Arduino: modify your piano to use your voice


4: Amplitude modulation: tremolo effect (low frequency modulation) ring effect (modulation with high frequency signal), modulation with triangular wave? Other waves?


5: Beats: add two cosine waves with close frequency (tuning), write as product (see itâ€™s a modulation)


Arduino project: voice tremolo effect or more general voice modifier (e.g. https://www.instructables.com/Dalek-Voice-Changer-Arduino-Shield/)
