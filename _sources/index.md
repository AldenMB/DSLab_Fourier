# The Data Science Labs on Fourier Analysis

Part 1: SYNTHESIZING


What is the meaning of Fourier series coefficients?
1-3: Play a pure cosine wave. Play the scale. Play a song. Observe that playing song twice as fast is faster AND higher pitch. (Fourier series properties) Play a sum of sine and cosine waves with different coefficients. (What are the FS coefficients of sound you create).  Create your own sound (an entire scale). Play a song.

Projects: make a piano, make an instrument where frequency of sound is controlled by ultrasonic distance sensor


4: record voice, scale time to create higher pitch; play a song.

Arduino: modify your piano to use your voice??


5-6: Amplitude modulation: tremolo effect (low frequency modulation) ring effect (modulation with high frequency signal), modulation with triangular wave? Other waves?

Project: voice tremolo effect or more general voice modifier (e.g. https://www.instructables.com/Dalek-Voice-Changer-Arduino-Shield/) 



(Beats: add two cosine waves with close frequency (tuning), write as product (see itâ€™s a modulation)) 



Part 2: ANALYZING


7-9 DFT 


projects: Instrument tuning, Step frequency analysis (compare with thresholding to find steps)

10 Filtering 

projects: remove low-frequency (fan?) noise???
